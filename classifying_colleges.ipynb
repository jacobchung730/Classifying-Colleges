    "#### Executive Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project is designed to help people apply to college, especially the underprivileged, by allowing them to fill out their ideal university criteria details and helping them figure out whether to look into public, private, or for-profit universities as they begin their college application process. Many students do not have access to good college resources such as counselors or might be the first in their families to navigate the applications, so figuring out the best type of universities to fit them is an important step.\n",
    "\n",
    "We obtained our dataset from Kaggle. After performing various data wrangling and manipulation, we found it was most efficient to one-hot encode our categorical variables and now use quantitative variables such as as tuition, enrollment, and location. Given some of these feature variables as input, our algorithm will be able to predict whether a school with those characteristics is more likely to be public, private, or for profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We started off by using k-Nearest Neighbors, Guassian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. By using recusive feature elimination and hyper parameter tuning, we were able to improve the accuracy of our results. We discovered that the two most efficient algorithms to use were k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree, with Decision Tree performing slightly more optimally. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon concluding our project, we were able to determine that the three most important features in classifying a school as public, private, or for-profit are in_state_tuition, out_of_state_total, and total_enrollment. In the future, we feel that we could use more feature variables, add more data points, and also train our model with other algorithms such as Support Vector Machine. "

    "<h4>Problem Statement</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our project focuses on helping students apply to college by narrowing down their choices. Nowadays it is almost essential to obtain a college degree in order to gain an advantage in the workforce and have a step up in life. A college degree is seen in our society almost as a commodity because it carries much more social value than just pure knowledge and education. For our project, we will try to classify colleges into either public, private, or for-profit universities based on criteria that a prospective student might be looking for. For a student who is beginning their college process and has an idea of the enrollment size they would like, the ideal tuition cost, or location, our project could be of benefit to them. Our algorithm will point them toward the best type of institution options for them by predicting whether their inputs fall into the public, private, or for-profit categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Significance of the Problem</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe that it is important to tackle this problem because it is relevant to us as students along with the\n",
    "whole country as a system. Some people in our world unfortunately do not have access to as many resources to be as\n",
    "knowledgeable about the college process as others. For example, first generation applicants or those who do not have college counselors are people who might need guidance about what types of schools to look for, given their backgrounds and preferences. Ideally, our program would be a resource for anyone with internet access to learn more about the best college type for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Questions</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Do schools have enough common charactersitics among each other to train an ML algorithm? On the other hand, is each college too unique from each other or to be able to do accurately do this?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our target varible will be the type of college, and all other variables will be feature variables. Therefore, we will be predicting whether a college is private, public, or for profit given the feature variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "We think that in state tuition, out of state tuition, total enrollment, and whether the degree length is 2 vs 4 years will all play important factors.

We also think that total enrollment may play a factor because public schools tend to be really large while some private schools are very small.\n",

    "The three ML algorithms we will be using are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "* k-Nearest Neighbors: This algorithm first finds the k most similar instances based on distance between this point and other points. Then it gets the labels of these instances and a majority vote is taken to determine the prediction. The pro is that this has reasonable performance without a lot of adjustments, but the con is that it can be pretty slow. We chose this because from what we have seen with past datasets, this algorithm has high performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gaussian Naive Bayes: This algorithm is a probabilistic algorithm that makes the assumption that all features are equally important. The pro is that this works well with high dimensional data, but the con is that the assumption that features are conditionally independent is naive. We think this will be a good baseline to compare to our other algorithms to see if features may relate to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Tree: This algorithm uses a hierarchy of if/else questions which can quickly lead to a decision. The pro is that no feature normalization or scaling is typically needed, but the con is that we usually need multiples of trees for better generalization performance. We chose this because it breaks down complex data into more manageable parts and is easy to visualize. "

    "We compared k-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. k-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree performed relatively the same, both performing better than Gaussian Naive Bayes. However, Decision Tree slightly outperformed k-Nearest Neighbors. After hyperparamter tuning, we found that an n_neighbors value of 3 and a the defualt max_depth value of None were optimal for our algorithms. Now, we were able to increase classficiation accuracy by about half of a percent. Therefore, we believe that Decision Tree should be used for our predictive model because it had the overall highest classification accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to predict our outcome variable of school type using our features such as enrollment count, in state tution cost, and out of state tuition cost. Using recursive feature elimination, we were able to conclude that in_state_tuition, out_of_state_total, and total_enrollment were the three most important features for our classification algorithm. When comparing our model using all the features vs the selected features, we found that our model performed better using only the selected features.\n",

    "An ethical implication our of project would be the issue of classism and how some are not able to afford an education. Those who are more affluent are often able to get into the schools they desire, while it may possbily be harder for someone not as wealthy to be able to get into and afford their dream school. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to do this project again, there are a few things that we would like to change. First, we would like to have more instances of for-profit schools. For-profit schools were severely under represented while public and private schools had many more instances in this dataset. Also, we could have had more feature columns such as international student count and also graduation rate. Intuitively, we think that public schools may possbily have a slightly lower graduation rate than a private school. We think this because private schools charge more tuition so one is less likely to drop out or else they would have lost more money. In the future, an extension of this project could use another classification algorithm such as Support Vector Machine and compare its performance to that of the algorithms we already trained and tested.
